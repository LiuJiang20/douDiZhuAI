compute_episodic_return() ->
    v_s_, why we need this variable. Thought the function is going to compute the rewards.


forward()->
    1. model(neural net) returns q, h. I assume q are all action values, and h are some hidden info that is only
    necessary in RNN.
    2. q, h = model(obs_, state=state, info=batch.info), if we are making predictions, what do positional argument
    state and info do? Simple pytorch example I found online doesn't have last 2 arguments.
    3. Does batch contains single piece of information
    4. 这段代码是不是为了兼容性
        obs = getattr(batch, input)
        obs_ = obs.obs if hasattr(obs, 'obs') else obs



info for my self:
batch contains single pieces of information,
To know how batch is contructed for policy, see collector.py, line 273, 285.
